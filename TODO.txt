This program is functional but has room for improvements.

1. Not all errors and warnings can be disabled or enabled yet.

2. When outputting a file it is not possible to disable or enable specific cleanups
   or optimizations.  This will be added in a future release.

3. More cleanups and optimizations like transforming geometry (removing loc an rot)
   will be added in a future release.

4. When outputting a file it is not possible to change its type.

   acclint file.ac -o file.acc

   will not convert a .ac file to the .acc file format.  Use accc from TORCS or
   Speed Dreams to do this conversion.

   acclint file.acc -o file.ac

   will not convert a .acc file to the .ac file format.  This feature will be added
   in a future release.

5. More checks like validating normals will be added in a future release.

6. Only a single file can be checked.  Multiple files could be checked at once
   but outputting a file complicates things.  We could not allow outputting a file
   when multiple inputs are present or we could merge multiple inputs into a single
   output.

7. I'm conflicted about the name acclint. This name makes sense for TORCS and Speed
   Dreams content developers because they are accustomed to using both .ac and .acc
   files.  Because .acc files are an extension to the .ac file format this tool can
   handle both formats and has format specific checks.

   This tool will work perfectly fine for projects like Flight Gear that use the
   .ac file format exclusively.

   An alternative name could be ac3dlint but the ac3d 3D modeler doesn't support
   the .acc file format and that may confuse an ac3d modeler user.

   I hope the acclint name doesn't limit it's use to just TORCS and Speed Dreams.
